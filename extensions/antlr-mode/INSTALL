The installation process with explanations (all files mentioned here are
relative to top-level directory "antlr-mode/" in the distribution):


 0. You can check whether antlr-mode.el is already included in your Emacs
    (e.g., Emacs-21+) by visiting an ANTLR grammar file and/or by using:

       M-x locate-library RET antlr-mode.el RET


 1. Copy file "lisp/antlr-mode.el" to your load-path.  That means:

    Use C-h v load-path RET to check the value and the documentation of
    Emacs' load-path.

    You must copy "lisp/antlr-mode.el" to one of the directories in the
    value list.  If no directory in the default value is appropriate, you
    must add "your own" directory to that list.

    The cases:

      (a) You want to copy the file to DIR, i.e., one of the listed
          directories: copy "lisp/antlr-mode.el" to DIR.

      (b) You use Emacs and install Antlr-Mode in your home directory:
          create directory "~/.emacs.d/lisp/" and copy "lisp/antlr-mode.el"
          to it.  Add the following lines at the beginning of your Emacs
          init file:

             (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
                             load-path))

      (c) You use XEmacs-20.3 or higher and install Antlr-Mode in your
          home directory: create directory
          "~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/".  It will be automatically
          added to `load-path' if you start XEmacs the next time.

      (d) You install Antlr-Mode system-wide: the target directory is
          "EMACS/site-lisp/" or "XEMACS/site-packages/lisp/".  But you
          probably know that if you are responsible for Emacs or XEmacs on
          your site.


 2. Byte-compile file "antlr-mode.el": visit file "antlr-mode.el" (that is,
    the copy) and use menu entry

       "Emacs-Lisp"/"Lisp" >> "Byte-compile This File"
    or
        M-x byte-compile-file RET antlr-mode.el RET.


 3. Visit your Emacs init file.

     - The Emacs init file is usuall file "~/.emacs".
     - In XEmacs-21.4 or higher, it is usually "~/.xemacs/init.el".
     - For a system-wide installation, the init file is "default.el".

    If antlr-mode.el was not already included in your Emacs, add the
    following lines into your init file (it should be inserted after the
    lines from case 1b):

       (autoload 'antlr-mode "antlr-mode" nil t)
       (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.g\\'" . antlr-mode) auto-mode-alist))

    If you use an older version of speedbar, also include

       (add-hook 'speedbar-load-hook  ; would be too late in antlr-mode.el
                 (lambda () (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".g")))
